# hello-world

I need to learn how to program..........
I'm trying to start with Java, but I don't know how to start. I've whatched some tutorials and I learned the basic "Hello World" program:

    package com.company;

    public class HelloWorldApp {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello World"!);
      
        }
    }

I want to learn more, just for fun, thats it :)
